        Think of CILAS as an autonomous scholarly collective rather than a
        corporate academic institution or a modern/colonial university. It does
        not issue credit points or an accredited degree. As a member of the
        learning community you will be supported and challenged in your
        inquiries. Opposed to a pedagogy of consumption, CILAS operates under a
        pedagogy of attunement and discovery. This is to say that what we cover
        at CILAS matters less than what we discover together. Discussion Based
        Learning is the main teaching/learning methodology at CILAS and relies
        heavily on the participation and solidarity of everyone.
